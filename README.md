Bike Rental Demand Prediction Project
A comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict bike rental demand for urban bike-sharing systems. The project addresses the challenge of optimizing bike distribution by predicting rental patterns based on weather conditions, temporal factors, and seasonal variations.
Data Background and Preparation
Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset
Scale: 8,760 samples with 14 features
Quality: Complete dataset with no missing values
Features: Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall), temporal data (hour, date, season), and operational data (holiday, functioning day)

Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Distribution Analysis: Identified normally distributed features (temperature, humidity, dew point) vs. skewed features (bike count, wind speed, visibility, solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall)
Data Transformation:

Applied log transformation to bike rental count and wind speed
Used Box-Cox transformation (λ=-1.4238) for visibility
Converted highly skewed features (solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall) to binary categorical features


Outlier Management: Implemented Z-score method (threshold=3) to detect and remove outliers
Feature Engineering:

One-hot encoding for multi-categorical variables (seasons)
Boolean to integer conversion for binary features
Z-score standardization for all numerical features



Machine Learning Modeling
Traditional Statistical Models

Linear Regression Baseline: Achieved R² = 0.79 using forward selection for feature selection
Regularization Techniques:

Lasso Regression: R² = 0.60 (less effective due to over-penalization)
Ridge Regression: R² = 0.79 (marginal improvement)


Polynomial Regression: R² = 0.84 (significant improvement, indicating non-linear relationships)

Machine Learning Models
Model Preprocessing for Tree-based Models:

Maintained original feature scaling (trees don't require normalization)
Applied feature engineering with binary categorical features
Used 22 important features for prediction

Model Performance Comparison:

Decision Tree:

R² = 0.70
Fast baseline but prone to overfitting
High variance in predictions


Random Forest:

R² = 0.86 (Best Performance)
MSE: 57,764.85
MAE: 147.86
Superior accuracy through ensemble averaging


XGBoost:

R² = 0.86
MSE: 58,031.97
MAE: 149.80
Sequential tree building with error correction



Key Technical Insights
Model Philosophy Comparison

Traditional Models: Focus on explaining relationships with interpretable equations, rely on statistical assumptions
Machine Learning Models: Prioritize prediction accuracy, assumption-light approach, better handling of complex non-linear patterns

Feature Importance
The models identified weather conditions, temporal patterns (hour, season), and operational status as key predictive factors for bike rental demand.
